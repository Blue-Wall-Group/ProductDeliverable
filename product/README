The product deliverable is the index.html file contained in this folder. 

The productDeliverable.zip file must be unzipped to be rendered properly. 
Terms that are underlined with a dotted line will provide a tooltip
with a definition when hovered over with the cursor. Any external links
listed in the document navigate to live URLs and must have a valid internet
connection to be accessed. The images/ folder and style.css are files that
the index.html file uses to reference content and should not be modified.
